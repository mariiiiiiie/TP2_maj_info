## Tasks to Accomplish

In this part we are going to create two clients : one for downloading a file from the server; one for uploading a file to the server.

### To obtain request information

We create a programm to display the file and the host, two parameters in arguments. We get the following result

### To obtain the serverâ€™s address.

We make a code that goes trought the linked list 'result'. We can check the server's address by display this address. We get :

</br>

### Connection socket to the server.

We complete our own code to reserve a connection socket to server.
